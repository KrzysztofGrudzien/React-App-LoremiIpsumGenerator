# Lorem Ipsum Generator

## About project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app was created to improve and develop JS and React skills. Application is very easy to use and gives us a similar solution like in many other applications of that type. The app tries to be as dynamic as possible. If you only choose something the view is automatically updated and you get what you expect. For paragraphs and sentences, you can generate a max of 20 items, so if you write more than 20 the program setup automatically values equal to 20.
